# Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of 'intelligent agents': any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is often used to describe machines that mimic 'cognitive' functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as 'learning' and 'problem-solving'.

# AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney), and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).

# As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from the definition of AI, having become a routine technology.
